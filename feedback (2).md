## Overall
*Overall mark (%) and final possible final comments*
It is apparent that you did not have enough time on this project. I see that
much of the code is directly copied from the lecture notes from the course and I
won't give feedback on this. We really want to help you get through this course,
and it is hard for us to do that if you won't ask us for help. As the sessions
are now done, please ask us questions on Piazza, mail or come visit us at the
office if you are struggling with certain parts of the projects. Morten, Bendik
and I (Ã˜yvind) are situated in the physics building on the west side in rooms
308, 309 and 304 respectively. Kristine is in the informatics building, but I'm
unsure as to where exactly. You are most welcome to stop by if there is
something that you want help with in terms of project 3.
